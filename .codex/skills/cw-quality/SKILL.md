Run in order and stop at the first failure: `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:architecture`, `pnpm test:integration`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm changeset status`. A missing script is reported as **not available**. End with one line per step: PASS, FAIL, not run or not available.
